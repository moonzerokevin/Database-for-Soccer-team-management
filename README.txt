This project will provide admin users with the ability to manage the related data of a soccer league. This includes inserting new tuples of data, removing tuples from tables, and performing on-delete cascade to delete corresponding tuples from other tables.
Users can also view selected and filtered attributes they are interested in, along with other interesting information that we believe would be of interest to most people
